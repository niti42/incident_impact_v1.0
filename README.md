Business Problem:

To predict the impact of the incident raised by the customer.

Objective:

- Whenever a service being provided to the customer is disrupted, the customer raises a complaint to the customer service; who in turn raises a ticket. 
- When an incident is logged, a lot of data related to the incident is recorded for ex: time, status â€¦
- Our objective is to predict the impact of an incident i.e whether it is High, Medium or Low. So that the company can optimize the resource allocation 
  to focus on the important incidents.
- A quicker resolution translates to customer satisfaction/retention which leads to better business.
